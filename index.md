# `GaGiNang Phonetics (GG NP)` Roadmap

`GaGiNang`: `/gɑgnɑ̃ŋ/` `/fənɛtɪks/`
- TODO

# Motivation for `GG NP`
I am interested in the `SwaTao` Phonetic Inventory Project for many reasons! Here are a few:

1. Interesting Phonetic Properties
	1. `Teochew` has rich Phonetic properties, yet the `SwaTao` variety seems to have less resources than `Teochew` in Western literature
		1. Ex: Interesting `Tone Type` and `Tone Category` system
	2. I hope that other people (linguists, heritage speakers, curious souls) will be able to use this as a resource to learning and documenting more of `Teochew`--and perhaps maybe inspire people to be excited about language documentation the way [`Learn Teochew`](https://learn-teochew.github.io) has inspired me! 
2. Journey to Becoming a Better Linguist
	1. As a fledgling linguist, I hope to work on a language similar to my background in Mandarin and Cantonese to improve my understanding of linguistics (and one day, hopefully become a great linguist!)
		1. Hopefully in the future, I can use the skills I gain as a linguist to help make the world a *better place*
3. `GaGiNang` (*Our People*)
	1. Many of which the people who I care about are a part belong to the `Teochew`/`GaGiNang` community. Thus, I wish to learn more about `Teochew` Language to connect more deeply with other `GaGiNang`s!

# Introduction
## `SwaTao` Language Family
The `SwaTao (汕头)` variety falls under the `Sino-Tibetan` language family as a `Southern Teochew Min (潮州闽)` variety. It is one of the main varieties of `Teochew` which also includes `Teochew Proper` and other "Northern"  and "Southern" Teochew Min [^1].
//TODO try to use `Teochew` for both Teochew porper and swatao and `SwaTao` when just this one

```

## Orthography and Transcription 
Since Teochew, like many other varieties spoken in Guangdong and China, is no longer officially taught in schools in favor of Mandarin, the writing and transcription system is [pseudo-standardized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng%27im). Thus, we will be use two types of orthography and transcription.
1. Orthography
	1. Teochew Orthography (similar to Mandarin Characters though not always the same)
	2. Mandarin Orthography[^2]
	3. English Orthography
2. Phonetic Transcription
	1. Teochew `Peng'im` also known as `GaGiNang Peng'im` [^3]
	2. International Phonetic Alphabet: IPA

## General Approach
As I was very unfamiliar with this language, here is the general framework used for probing `SwaTao`:
1. Use literature and resources to create a contrastive phonetic inventory
2. Record a native speaker and asked them for feedback on whether utterances grammatical
3. Adjust the transcriptions and interpretations based on working with the speaker

<small>Additionally, I tried to learn how to produce some of the segements in order to more easily do the state timing diagrams and Constriction Locations</small>
## Language Resources[^4]
1. [`Learn Teochew with Ah Boon`](https://learn-teochew.github.io)
	1. `Learn Teochew` is the primary source for many of the initial transcriptions, phonetic inventories, and grammatical rules. He also has a series of videos describing `Teochew` proper with IPA.
	2. Many of the transcriptions are based off of his and then modified based on the variety of `Swatao` the participant in this project speaks.
2. Mrs. Lisa Li (李丽华夫人) for participating in the data collection and for being 
3. Online Websites
	1. [WhatTCSay3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whattcsay3/id1551477228) English to `Teochew` Dictionary 
	2. Wikipedia

[^1]: Language Family divided into proper and geographical [varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_Min)
[^2]: As a Cantonese speaker, it was sometimes easier to translate sentences into Mandarin Orthography before creating the English gloss. Also, I hope that any other interested people or Linguistics students may also find this work interested and perhaps benefits from having more glosses.
[^3]: After finishing the phonetic recordings with my speaker, we talked more about `SwaTao` culture, including the  phrase `GaGiNang` or `/gaginaŋ/`, written in `Teochew` as 胶己人 or in Mandarin 自己人. `GaGiNang` has three meanings: (1) Literal: "Our own people", (2) Geographical: The `Teochew` region, and (3) An idea that unites all `Teochew` people from all different backgrounds, diaspora, and identification
[^4]: Huge thanks to Mrs. Li for her patience and help with repeating words and helping to find what utterances provided in the literature were ungrammatical in `SawTao`. Also, Mr. Ah Boon's `Learn Teochew` is an indispensable and inspiring resource for this `Teochew` language documentation.
