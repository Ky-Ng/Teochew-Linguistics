# What is `GaGiNang Phonetics (GG NP)`?
IPA: `GaGiNang`: `/gɑgnɑ̃ŋ/` `/fənɛtɪks/`
- The term `GaGiNang`, `胶己人`，or `自己人` in general, refers to the geography, group of people, and shared cultural identity of the `Teochew` people
- Currently,`GG NP` documents a small portion of the sophisticated phonetics of the `SwaTao` `Teochew Min` variety for academic linguistic, language documentation, and language learning purposes

___
# Motivation for `GG NP`
I am interested in the `SwaTao` Phonetic Inventory Project for many reasons! Here are a few:

1. Interesting Phonetic Properties
	1. `Teochew` has rich Phonetic properties, yet the `SwaTao` variety seems to have less resources than `Teochew` in Western literature
		1. Ex: Interesting `Tone Type` and `Tone Category` system
	2. I hope that other people (linguists, heritage speakers, curious souls) will be able to use this as a resource to learning and documenting more of `Teochew`--and perhaps maybe inspire people to be excited about language documentation the way [`Learn Teochew`](https://learn-teochew.github.io) has inspired me! 
2. Journey to Becoming a Better Linguist
	1. As a fledgling linguist, I hope to work on a language similar to my background in Mandarin and Cantonese to improve my understanding of linguistics (and one day, hopefully become a great linguist!)
		1. Hopefully in the future, I can use the skills I gain as a linguist to help make the world a *better place*
3. `GaGiNang` (*Our People*)
	1. Many of which the people who I care about are a part belong to the `Teochew`/`GaGiNang` community. Thus, I wish to learn more about `Teochew` Language to connect more deeply with other `GaGiNang`s!

# Introduction
## `SwaTao` Language Family
The `SwaTao (汕头)` variety falls under the `Sino-Tibetan` language family as a `Southern Teochew Min (潮州闽)` variety. It is one of the main varieties of `Teochew` which also includes `Teochew Proper` and other "Northern"  and "Southern" Teochew Min [^1].

**`SwaTao` Language Family Tree**[^1]
```
Sino-Tibetan
└── Sinitic
    └── Chinese
        └── Min
            └── Northern Min
            └── Southern Min
                └── Teochew
	                └── Teochew Proper
	                └── SwaTao
```

### Clarification: `SwaTao` vs. `Teochew` vs. `Teochew Proper`

| Variety          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Use in `GG NP`                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Teochew`        | Refers to the entire family of `Teochew` varieties including `Teochew Proper` and `SwaTao`<br><br>                                                                                                                                     | Used in `GG NP` when the phonetic finding is believed to extend to all varieties of `Teochew`                                                     |
| `Teochew Proper` | Refers to a variety of `Teochew` that is standardized which [`GuangDong Peng'im`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng%27im)is based off of<br><br>Used by many formal literature and [`Learn Teochew`](https://learn-teochew.github.io) | Used in `GG NP` to describe literature description/transcription when production by native `SwaTao` speaker differs from literature transcription |
| `SwaTao`         | Refers to a variety of `Teochew` spoken in the `ShanTou` (`汕头`) area of `GuangDong`<br><br>`ShanTou` and `SwaTao` are the `Mandarin` and `SwaTao` romanization of `汕头` respectively                                                    | Used in `GG NP` to describe `SwaTao` when production by native `SwaTao` speaker differs from literature transcription                             |

## Orthography and Transcription 
Since `Teochew`, like many other varieties spoken in Guangdong and China, is no longer officially taught in schools in favor of `Mandarin`, the writing and transcription system is [pseudo-standardized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng%27im). Thus, we will be use two types of orthography and transcription.
1. Orthography
	1. Teochew Orthography (similar to Mandarin Characters though not always the same)
	2. Mandarin Orthography[^2]
	3. English Orthography
2. Phonetic Transcription
	1. Teochew `Peng'im` also known as `GaGiNang Peng'im` [^3]
	2. International Phonetic Alphabet: IPA

## General Approach
As I was very unfamiliar with this language, here is the general framework used for probing `SwaTao`:
1. Use literature and resources to create a contrastive phonetic inventory
2. Record a native speaker and asked them for feedback on whether utterances grammatical
3. Adjust the transcriptions and interpretations based on working with the speaker

<small>Additionally, I tried to learn how to produce some of the segements in order to more easily do the state timing diagrams and Constriction Locations</small>
## Language Resources[^4]
1. [`Learn Teochew with Ah Boon`](https://learn-teochew.github.io)
	1. `Learn Teochew` is the primary source for many of the initial transcriptions, phonetic inventories, and grammatical rules. He also has a series of videos describing `Teochew` proper with IPA.
	2. Many of the transcriptions are based off of his and then modified based on the variety of `Swatao` the participant in this project speaks.
2. Mrs. Lisa Li (李丽华夫人) for participating in the data collection and for being 
3. Online Websites
	1. [WhatTCSay3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whattcsay3/id1551477228) English to `Teochew` Dictionary 
	2. Wikipedia
4. [Online Formant Plotting Tool](https://adamb924.github.io/formant-plot/)

[^1]: Language Family divided into proper and geographical [varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_Min)
[^2]: As a Cantonese speaker, it was sometimes easier to translate sentences into Mandarin Orthography before creating the English gloss. Also, I hope that any other interested people or Linguistics students may also find this work interested and perhaps benefits from having more glosses.
[^3]: After finishing the phonetic recordings with my speaker, we talked more about `SwaTao` culture, including the  phrase `GaGiNang` or `/gaginaŋ/`, written in `Teochew` as 胶己人 or in Mandarin 自己人. `GaGiNang` has three meanings: (1) Literal: "Our own people", (2) Geographical: The `Teochew` region, and (3) An idea that unites all `Teochew` people from all different backgrounds, diaspora, and identification
[^4]: Huge thanks to Mrs. Li for her patience and help with repeating words and helping to find what utterances provided in the literature were ungrammatical in `SawTao`. Also, Mr. Ah Boon's `Learn Teochew` is an indispensable and inspiring resource for this `Teochew` language documentation.
