# Motivation
- `GaGiNang` Phonetics is far from complete in its analysis of `SwaTao`, let alone the other varieties of `Teochew`
- The motivation of this section is to address potential limitations of the research findings and share the possible next steps and goals of more deeply investigating `Teochew` 
- The `Future Investigations` are split up into the three areas of investigation: `Consonants`, `Vowels` and `Tones`

____
# Consonants
1. *Minimal* Contrastive Environments
	1. Currently minimal contrastive pairs for consonants are recorded in [`Phonetically Rich Sentences`] rather than in isolated environments with pauses between each segment
		1. This could introduce latent [prosodic influences] 
2. Word Final Consonants
	1. `Teochew` word finals[^1] may also include an optional consonant
	2. Thus, it would be interesting to investigate whether there are differences between consonants in `onset` versus `word final` positions

___
# Vowels
1. *Minimal* Contrastive Environments
	1. Although the `/i/`, `/e/`, `/ɑ/`, and `/o/` are recorded in a `/mV/` context, `/u/` and `/ɤ/` were recorded in a `/gu/` and `/kɤ/` context
	2. Further investigation should record all vowels in the same `/CV/` context or even `/V/` context
		1. Currently the vowels are time sliced out to include `stable regions` with no formant change to compensate for the different contexts
2. Diphthong Timing Data
	1. As `Teochew` also has diphthongs, further investigations can seek to understand the distribution of timings of diphthongs under a fixed `tone` condition
3. Vowel Lengthening
	1. Since `Teochew` final consonants can be both `voiced` and `voiceless`, further investigations can seek to understand whether or not vowels are lengthened depending on the `voicing` of the final consonant
4. Investigating `Allophonic Variation` between `/e/` vs. `/ɛ/`
	1. See [Investigating `/e/` vs. `/ɛ/`] for context
	2. Future Investigation
		1. Since there was only one speaker, it is difficult to draw a conclusion as to whether or not the high `F1` value for the `/e/` phoneme is a result of:
			1. The individual speaker's manner of speech
			2. The `SwaTao` variety versus the `Teochew Proper` variety
			3. The `/e/` and `/ɛ/` are in `allophonic variation`
		2. To investigate whether `/e/` and `/ɛ/` are in allophonic variation, future investigations should compare the `F2-F1` and `F1` of all `/e/` and `/ɛ/` like phonemes. 
		3. If a `bimodal` distribution occurs, then the two vowels are in `allophnic variation`
	3. Vowel Shifting across Speakers and Varieties (`/ɯ/` to `/ɤ/` and `/a/` to `/ɑ/`)
		1. See [Possible Reasons For Vowel Shifting] for context
		2. Future Investigation
			1. Future investigations should compare `F2-F1` and `F1` data from other speakers of `SwaTao` and other `Teochew` varieties.
			2. If a `biomodal` distribution occurs between`/ɯ/` vs.`/ɤ/` and `/a/` vs. `/ɑ/`, then there is a vowel shift between `Teochew` varieties
		3. Note: the `/ɯ/` and `/a/` are from `Teochew Proper` literature

___
# Tones
1. Tone Sandhi
	1. `Tone Sandhi` is the change of a word's tone depending on the tone of the following word
		1. Documentation on `SwaTao` `Tone Sandhi` in [`Learn Teochew`](https://learn-teochew.github.io/pages/pronunciation.html#tone-sandhi) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_Min#Tones)
	2. Future Investigation should verify that the recorded literature `Tone Sandhi` occurs in the same way in the `SwaTao` variety
2. More Speaker Data in `SwaTao`
	1. The researched `F0` modulation is based off of a single `SwaTao` speaker, future investigations should track the distribution of modulation across many speakers
3. Tone Shifts Across Varieties
	1. Future investigations can also seek to record `Sandhi` and compare the tone change in `SwaTao` versus other `Teochew` varieties such as `Teochew Proper`

___
[^1]:  Phonemes occurring at the end of a word. In `Teochew`'s `/CVC/` segments the last `C` is considered a final consonant
